## Consolidated History (Pre-2026-03-13)

### Footer Evolution
- Started with basic footer → Datawizz-inspired redesign with giant "TRINADE" text, SVG social icons, atmospheric gradient layers, grain overlay
- Multiple iterations: spacing, breathing room, bottom bar visibility, viewport height fitting
- Final: `h-screen flex flex-col`, `text-[clamp(5rem,12vw,14vw)]`, 7 gradient orbs, conditional WebGL via `withBackground` prop

### Theme Evolution
- Started with dark-only theme → switched to light/dark hybrid
- Light sections: warm cream (#f5f3ef → tried #f0e6d3 → #f8f5f0 → settled on #e8e4de/#f5f3ef)
- Fixed hero bg flash issue (WebGL bg was being covered by light bg during reveal)
- Adaptive cursor: auto-switches dark/light via CSS

### Page Build History
- **About page**: 8-section cinematic page (~1050 lines). Manifesto hero, origin story, philosophy (teal-numbered editorial rows), journey timeline, stats, values, team teaser, closing CTA. Company founded in 2020.
- **Team page**: Cinematic intro + 8 member rows with NextNet-inspired full-width horizontal layout, mesh gradient portrait placeholders, click-to-expand bios
- **Contact V1→V2→V3**: Evolved from basic form → glassmorphic dark design → premium editorial dark layout with oversized typography, split layout, community section

### Background Experiments
- Hero background concepts page with 5 green gradient variations
- Footer concepts page with 10 distinct variations
- Contact page backgrounds: tried MagicUI DotPattern with glow (5520 animated SVGs — caused severe lag), replaced with lightweight CSS dot pattern tile

### Typography & Font
- Explored 10 fonts → settled on Manrope (single unified family, weights 200-800)
- Scaled up site-wide to Awwwards-level oversized sizing

## 2026-03-13 — Contact V3: Performance fix + Dropdown polish

### Performance Fix
- **Problem**: MagicUI DotPattern with `glow={true}` created 5,520 individual `<motion.circle>` elements with independent JS animation loops → severe lag
- **Fix**: Replaced with single CSS `background-image` using inline SVG data URI tile (28x28px) + `mask-image` radial gradient for fading effect
- DotPattern component kept in `components/ui/dot-pattern.tsx` for potential smaller-surface use

### Dropdown Polish (4 iterations)
1. Fixed double scrollbars (removed `max-h`/`overflow-y-auto` + `overflow-hidden` conflict)
2. Added `.scrollbar-premium` custom scrollbar class (3px teal-tinted, cross-browser)
3. User rejected scrollbar entirely → widened grid column to 220px, all 10 countries fit without scrolling
4. Fixed trackpad scroll capture: `onWheel stopPropagation` + `overscrollBehavior: contain`

### Contact V3 Background Layers
- CSS dot pattern tile (28x28px, teal, 14% opacity) with radial gradient mask
- Atmospheric layers: teal bloom top-left, amber undertone center-right, deep emerald bottom
- Cinematic vignette + grain texture overlay
