## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 30: Navbar Alignment + Logo Strength + Folder Reorganization

### What Was Done
1. **TRINADE text + logo aligned to Menu pill text** — Previously both were at `top-5` (20px), aligned with the pill's top edge. Measured centers precisely via Playwright: TRINADE center was 43px, Menu text center was 48px. Adjusted TRINADE to `top: 34px` and logo to `top: 30px` so all three elements share a vertical center of 48px.
2. **Logo outlines strengthened 3x** — Added `contrast(3)` to the logo CSS filter on both light and dark backgrounds. Also bumped opacity from 0.85 → 1 for maximum clarity. The neural mesh details are now crisp and bold.
3. **Products folder moved to Content/** — Moved `trinade-new/Products/` into `trinade-new/Content/Products/` for better content organization.

### Files Changed
- `components/solutions-navbar.tsx` — TRINADE text top position (20px → 34px), logo top position (20px → 30px), logo filter added `contrast(3)`, logo opacity 0.85 → 1
- `Content/Products/` — Moved from `Products/` root

### Verification
- Playwright `getBoundingClientRect()` confirms all three navbar elements (TRINADE, Menu text, logo) share vertical center at 48px
- Tested on both light (homepage hero) and dark (footer) sections — adaptive color transitions work correctly

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 29: Company Page Polish — Values + Team Cards

### What Was Done
1. **Values description left-aligned** — Removed the large left padding (`paddingLeft: clamp(60px,12vw,200px)` → `0`) from expanded value descriptions so text starts from the left edge with the icon, not centered.
2. **Team card expanded spacing reduced** — Tightened card padding from `clamp(16px,2vw,28px)` → `clamp(14px,1.6vw,22px)` and expanded bio paddingTop from `16px` → `12px`.
3. **Team bio description widened** — Increased maxWidth from `600px` → `850px` so bio text extends further right, saving vertical lines.
4. **Collapsed team card height increased** — Slightly larger collapsed image: width `clamp(80px,8vw,120px)` → `clamp(90px,9vw,130px)`, height `clamp(70px,7vw,100px)` → `clamp(80px,8vw,115px)`.

### Files Changed
- `app/company/page.tsx` — Values expanded area padding, team card padding, bio maxWidth, collapsed image dimensions

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 28: Preloader Always Shows on Homepage

### What Was Done
1. **Preloader triggers every visit** — Removed `sessionStorage` gating from `app/page.tsx` so the cinematic TRINADE preloader animation plays every time a user lands on or navigates to the homepage, not just once per session.
2. **Cleaned up sessionStorage** — Removed `sessionStorage.setItem('trinade-preloader-seen')` from `preloader-animation.tsx` since it's no longer needed. Removed unused `useEffect` import from `page.tsx`.

### Files Changed
- `app/page.tsx` — Removed sessionStorage check, `showPreloader` defaults to `true`
- `components/preloader-animation.tsx` — Removed sessionStorage write on completion

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 27: Products → 404 Redirect + Homepage Hero Viewport Fix

### What Was Done
1. **Products link → 404 page** — Changed Products href from `/solutions` to `/products` in both navbar (`solutions-navbar.tsx`) and footer (`solutions-footer.tsx`). Since no `/products` route exists, Next.js renders the existing `not-found.tsx` (dark atmospheric 404 with gold gradient, giant watermark, "Return to Home" CTA).
2. **Homepage hero contained in viewport** — Fixed hero section background overflow:
   - Changed `min-h-[100vh]` → `h-[100vh] h-[100dvh]` (exact viewport height, respects mobile dynamic viewport)
   - Made gradient card use `flex-1 min-h-0` to fill remaining space instead of `minHeight: 50vh`
   - Reduced heading font size from `clamp(3rem, 7vw, 6rem)` → `clamp(2.6rem, 6vw, 5.2rem)`
   - Tightened padding (`pt-40→pt-32`, `pb-12→pb-6`, `mb-20→mb-6`)
   - Verified: section height === viewport height (945px = 945px), zero overflow

### Files Changed
- `components/solutions-navbar.tsx` — Products href `/solutions` → `/products`
- `components/solutions-footer.tsx` — Products href `/solutions` → `/products`
- `components/homepage-content.tsx` — Hero section height, padding, font sizing, card flex layout

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 26: Company Page Content Update from Company.docx + Team Card Spacing

### What Was Done
1. **Company.docx content mapped** — Extracted all content from `Content/Company Page CONTENT/Company.docx` and mapped to every section of the Company page:
   - **Hero**: Subtitle → "We saw the future coming and we wanted to build it responsibly." Est. 2021 → Est. 2020

   - **Milestones**: All 6 updated — 2020 Founded, 2021 Product + Services Direction, 2023 Expansion Roadmap, 2024 Sleep Alert Device, 2025 Fly High, 2026 Website + Offerings Launch
   - **Team**: All 6 members replaced — Shubham Sakhare, Akash Sakhare, Renu Kumari, Havilah Sale, George Gideon, Peter (with bios from docx)
2. **Team card expanded spacing reduced** — Reduced padding around team member name/role area in expanded cards. Photo now better centered within the expanded card area. Removed fun fact section.

### Files Changed
- `app/company/page.tsx` — All content arrays (VALUES, TIMELINE, TEAM), hero, quote, vision, mission sections updated. Team card padding reduced.

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 25: Remove Learn More + Grainy Gold Glow on Sector Cards

### What Was Done
1. **"Learn more" removed** — Removed the hover-reveal "Learn more →" link from each IndustryCard in the sectors grid on the Solutions page (`/solutions`).
2. **Grainy gold glow background** — Added radial gold gradient (`rgba(201,168,110,0.18)` from bottom-right corner fading to transparent) behind each card. Layered SVG fractal noise grain texture overlay at 35% opacity with `mix-blend-mode: multiply` for a warm, organic, Awwwards-quality feel. Enhanced hover warm tint opacity from 0.04 to 0.06.

### Files Changed
- `components/solutions-content.tsx` — `IndustryCard` component: removed Learn more div, added grain SVG + radial gold gradient layers

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 24: Values Numbers + Quote Placement + Team Expand + Button Colors

### What Was Done
1. **Team photo effect removed** — Removed rotate/scale animation on team member portrait when expanding. Images now simply resize without tilt.
2. **Values static numbers** — Replaced `AnimatedCounter` (RAF-based animated 00→target) with static padded numbers (01, 02, 03, 04, 05). Numbers now visible immediately with slightly increased opacity.
3. **Quote before Vision** — QuoteSection moved from after Vision to between Hero and Vision. Section order: Hero → Quote → Vision → Mission → Values → Milestones → Team → Footer.
4. **Values text left-aligned** — Expanded description text changed from center to left alignment. Font size increased from 17px to 18px.
5. **Values headline bolder** — "Principles that guide every decision we make." weight changed from 300 to 500.
6. **Team card expand reduced** — Expanded image dimensions reduced from clamp(180px,18vw,280px) to clamp(140px,14vw,200px) width and clamp(220px,22vw,340px) to clamp(160px,16vw,240px) height.
7. **Plus buttons brown gold** — All toggle buttons (Values + Team) changed from light gray to brown gold (#a0814a border rgba(201,168,110,0.35)).

### Files Changed
- `app/company/page.tsx` — AnimatedCounter removed, QuoteSection repositioned, Values/Team button colors, team image dimensions, headline weight

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 23: CTA Removal + Quote Repositioned + Collapsing Team Images

### What Was Done
1. **CTA section removed** — "Let's build together" section above footer deleted entirely. Footer now follows directly after team section.
2. **Quote moved to top** — QuoteSection relocated from after team cards to after Vision section (Section 2), creating a powerful editorial flow: Vision → Quote → Mission.
3. **Team card images collapse/expand** — Image dimensions now animate between small thumbnail (collapsed: ~80-120px wide, ~70-100px tall) and large portrait (expanded: ~180-280px wide, ~220-340px tall). Eliminates void space in collapsed state. Initials font size also scales. Portrait tilts -2° on expand with deeper shadow.
4. **Team count reduced to 6** — Removed Priya Ramanathan (Head of Client Success) and Leo Nakamura (VP of Strategic Partnerships).

### Components Changed
- `TeamAccordion` — Rewritten with `motion.div` animating width/height/rotate/borderRadius on the portrait card. Collapsed = compact thumbnail aligned with text, expanded = large tilted portrait with bio below.
- `QuoteSection` — Moved placement (component unchanged)
- CTA section — Removed entirely (Section 7)

### Files Changed
- `app/company/page.tsx` — TEAM data (8→6), TeamAccordion rewrite, QuoteSection moved, CTA section removed

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 22: Team Cards Redesign + Quote Section + Impact Removal

### What Was Done
1. **Team cards redesigned** — New inspo-based layout with collapsed/expanded states. Collapsed: gold role label, large name (42px), italic tagline, ghost number (01-08) overlapping behind, mesh gradient portrait card on right with large initials, + toggle button. Expanded: bio paragraph + fun fact with gold "+" prefix appear below tagline, portrait tilts slightly with deeper shadow.
2. **Our Impact section removed** — Deleted the animated stat counters section (500+, 99.9%, 2.4B+, 12ms) and related STATS data + AnimatedStat component.
3. **Quote section added** — Striking Awwwards-quality editorial quote layout placed after team cards. Giant decorative open/close quotation marks (Georgia serif), large blockquote text (52px max) with gold left border, gold dash attribution with name and title. Scroll-triggered animations throughout.

### Components Changed/Added
- `TeamAccordion` — Complete rewrite with two-column grid layout (text left, portrait+toggle right), ghost numbers, AnimatePresence expand/collapse
- `QuoteSection` — New component with giant decorative quotation marks, editorial blockquote, gold dash attribution
- Removed: `AnimatedStat` component, `STATS` data array

### Files Changed
- `app/company/page.tsx` — TeamAccordion rewrite, QuoteSection (new), Impact section removed, STATS/AnimatedStat removed

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 21: Values Animated Counter + Milestones Refinement

### What Was Done
1. **Animated counter numbers** — Values accordion numbers now animate cinematically from 00→value on expand, value→00 on collapse using RAF with quartic ease curves
2. **More value content** — Each value description expanded with 2-3 additional sentences of meaningful content
3. **Text positioning** — Expanded value text shifted beyond center with `paddingLeft: clamp(60px, 12vw, 200px)`
4. **Milestone cards gap fix** — Removed fixed 440px height, cards now auto-size to content. Year has `marginBottom: 32px` instead of `space-between` causing huge void. Font 56px→48px, weight 200→300 for elegance
5. **Gold accent line** — Milestone top accent transitions on hover for subtle interactivity

### New Components
- `AnimatedCounter` — RAF-based number counter with quartic ease-out (expand) and quadratic ease-in (collapse)

### Files Changed
- `app/company/page.tsx` — VALUES data, ValuesAccordion, AnimatedCounter (new), MilestoneCard

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 20: Milestone Cards Layout Fix

### What Was Done
1. **Fixed year position** — changed `justifyContent: 'flex-end'` to `'space-between'` so year stays pinned at top regardless of content length
2. **Increased card size** — from 320×380px to 380×440px for less congestion
3. **Larger year typography** — 48px → 56px for more visual impact
4. **Better spacing** — padding increased from 36px 32px to 40px 36px, title 20px → 22px
5. **Content structure** — year at top, title+description wrapped in bottom div via space-between layout

### Files Changed
- `app/company/page.tsx` — MilestoneCard component (~lines 577-662)

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 19: Values Accordion Premium Redesign

### What Was Done
1. **Big decorative numbers** on right (01-05) — `clamp(48px, 5vw, 72px)`, weight 200, gold accent on expand
2. **Bolder title text** — weight 500, `clamp(24px, 3vw, 40px)`, stronger color (0.7 opacity)
3. **Larger toggle button** — 44px with gold border on expand
4. **Better icon positioning** — icon left of description in expanded area
5. **Gold gradient** top border for visual polish

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 18: Values Section Light Background + 5 Values

### What Was Done
1. **Values section background** — changed from dark (#0a0a0a) to cream (#f2ede6), removed spiral overlay and ambient glow
2. **Reduced to 5 values** — removed "Sustainable Growth" (V/06), keeping Led by Integrity, Driven by Innovation, Built on Partnership, Engineering Excellence, Human-Centered Design
3. **Updated all text/border colors** for light background (white→dark text, white borders→dark borders)

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 17: Company Page Visibility Fixes

### What Was Done
1. **"Est. 2021 · Guntur, India"** — increased opacity from 0.2→0.5 and font from 13px→14px for readability
2. **Mission numbers (01, 02, 03)** — gold opacity from 0.12→0.3, now visible as decorative elements
3. **Mission body text** — white opacity from 0.45→0.65, significantly improved readability

### Technical Lessons
- Very low opacity values (<0.2) are essentially invisible on dark backgrounds — minimum 0.3 for decorative, 0.5+ for readable text
- Verified all changes with Playwright MCP screenshots

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 16: Company Hero Typography

### What Was Done
1. **TRINADE text bolder** — weight 200→400, size `clamp(72px,15vw,220px)`, refined gradient with more white opacity, reduced stroke to `1px rgba(201,168,110,0.35)` for cleaner look
2. **All hero text sizes increased:**
   - "OUR STORY" eyebrow: 12px→14px
   - Subtitle: `clamp(16px,1.8vw,22px)`→`clamp(18px,2.2vw,26px)`, maxWidth 600→680px
   - "EST. 2021": 12px→13px
3. Verified with Playwright — hero has significantly more visual impact and readability

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 15b: Fix Dark Background Detection + Deploy

### What Was Done
1. **Fixed dynamic color detection** (`solutions-navbar.tsx`)
   - Root cause: `elementsFromPoint` + `backgroundColor` only caught solid colors, but dark sections use `linear-gradient` overlays (e.g., `rgba(26,26,30,0.72)`) which set `backgroundImage`, not `backgroundColor`
   - Added `backgroundImage` gradient parsing — extracts rgba values from gradient strings and calculates luminance
   - Added `data-dark-section` attribute check as reliable explicit marking
   - Removed fragile inline style string matching approach
2. **Added `data-dark-section` to all dark sections across site:**
   - `solutions-content.tsx`: MissionSection, CTA card
   - `solutions-footer.tsx`: Footer
   - `company/page.tsx`: Hero, Mission, Values, Milestones, Impact, CTA (6 sections)
   - `contact/page.tsx`: Hero section
3. **Rigorous Playwright verification** across all pages:
   - Solutions: Hero (cream→dark brown ✓), Mission dark (→light gold ✓)
   - Company: Hero dark (→light gold ✓), Light section (→dark brown ✓), Mission dark (→light gold ✓)
   - Contact: Hero dark (→light gold ✓), Form section cream (→dark brown ✓)
   - Blog: Hero cream (→dark brown ✓), Footer dark (→light gold ✓)
4. **Deployed to Vercel** — production build successful

### Technical Lessons
- `getComputedStyle(el).backgroundColor` returns `rgba(0,0,0,0)` for gradient backgrounds — must also check `backgroundImage`
- `backgroundImage.matchAll(/rgba?\(...\)/g)` reliably extracts colors from CSS gradient strings
- `data-dark-section` attributes are the most reliable detection method — immune to CSS parsing edge cases

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 15: Dynamic Navbar Color + Marquee Speed

### What Was Done
1. **Dynamic TRINADE text color** (`solutions-navbar.tsx`)
   - Samples background color at TRINADE position using `elementsFromPoint` + luminance check
   - Dark bg → light gold (#d4bb8a), Light bg → dark brown (#2a2218)
   - Smooth 0.5s CSS transition between states
   - Removed `mixBlendMode: 'difference'` (replaced by explicit color switching)
2. **Dynamic logo color** — same detection
   - Dark bg → warm gold filter (`brightness(1.2) sepia(1) hue-rotate(-10deg) saturate(0.6)`)
   - Light bg → black filter (`brightness(0)`)
   - Smooth 0.5s filter transition
3. **Marquee speed reduced** — 20s → 28s for more elegant pace

### Technical Approach
- Uses `document.elementsFromPoint(40, 40)` to sample elements at the TRINADE text position
- Skips navbar elements via `data-navbar` attribute
- Calculates luminance: `0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B < 80` = dark
- Runs on every scroll event (already batched with scroll percentage tracking)

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 14: Spiral Image Dimensions Audit

### What Was Done
- Audited all spiral images across every page using Playwright
- **Critical finding**: `spiral-lines-gold.jpg` is 736×1472 (portrait) but rendered at 1920×945+ across 9 usages — 2.6x upscale causing severe blur
- Provided recommended re-export dimensions:
  - `spiral-lines-gold.jpg` → 3840×2160 (4K landscape)
  - `spiral-arcs.jpg` → 3840×2160
  - `spiral-gold.jpg` → 3840×2160
  - `spiral-card.jpg` → 1500×1000
  - `spiral-motion.jpg` → 1500×1000

### Action Required
- User needs to re-export/regenerate these images at the recommended dimensions

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 13b: Footer Marquee Letter Outlines + Speed

### What Was Done
1. **Removed letter outlines** (`solutions-footer.tsx`)
   - `WebkitTextStroke: '1.5px rgba(185,155,100,0.18)'` → `'none'`
   - Letters A and R had visible stroke outlines inside the letter shapes — now clean solid fills
2. **Reduced marquee speed** — 12s → 20s for a more comfortable, elegant scroll pace

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 13: Footer Marquee + Company Watermark + Navbar Pill

### What Was Done
1. **Footer marquee speed + seamless loop** (`solutions-footer.tsx`)
   - Increased speed: 25s → 12s animation duration
   - Fixed abrupt restart: renamed keyframes, used `translate3d` for GPU acceleration, `width: max-content` for proper sizing
2. **Removed "COMPANY" watermark** from Company page hero (`app/company/page.tsx`)
   - Deleted the giant semi-transparent "COMPANY" text that sat behind "TRINADE"
3. **Increased navbar pill height** (`solutions-navbar.tsx`)
   - Changed inner pill padding from `py-2` to `py-2.5` for slightly taller feel

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 12: Remove Our Approach + Restore Company Page

### What Was Done
1. **Removed "Our Approach" (ScrollCardsSection) from Solutions page** (`solutions-content.tsx`)
   - Removed `<ScrollCardsSection />` from the render output
   - Industries section now flows directly into Challenges section
2. **Restored Prompt 7 Company page** (`app/company/page.tsx`)
   - Current simplified version (916 lines) backed up as `page-current-backup.tsx`
   - Restored the richer Prompt 7 version (1505 lines) from git commit `175d5d8`
   - Restored version has: cinematic dark hero with "OUR STORY" + giant "TRINADE", values accordion (V/01-V/06), full team section (8 members with expandable bios), timeline, stats, and CTA

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 11b: Navbar Active Dot Fix + Remove Home

### What Was Done
1. **Fixed double active dots** (`solutions-navbar.tsx`)
   - Products and Solutions both pointed to `/solutions`, causing two dots on the Solutions page
   - Added `noActiveDot` flag to Products link — active dot only shows on Solutions
2. **Removed "Home" from navbar menu**
   - Users can navigate home via "TRINADE" wordmark (top-left) or logo (top-right)
   - Menu now: Products, Solutions, Blog, Company, Contact

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 11: Navbar Products + Solutions Page Gap Fix

### What Was Done
1. **Added "Products" to navbar menu** (`solutions-navbar.tsx`)
   - Inserted between Home and Solutions in the menuLinks array
   - Points to `/solutions` route
2. **Fixed huge empty gap between "Our Approach" and "Challenges We Solve"** (`solutions-content.tsx`)
   - **Root cause**: `minHeight: ${totalScrollHeight}px` on the wrapper div forced 1960px height, but actual card content was much shorter, leaving ~960px of empty cream space
   - **Fix**: Removed the arbitrary `minHeight` calculation entirely — let content determine natural height
   - Reduced `paddingBottom` from `12vh` to `4vh` on the cards column
   - Removed unused `cardHeight` and `totalScrollHeight` variables

### Technical Lessons
- The scroll-driven sticky cards pattern needs the wrapper height to match actual content, not an arbitrary calculation
- `minHeight` with sticky positioning creates invisible dead space when content is shorter than the minimum

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 10c: Contact Page Left Card Redesign

### What Was Done
1. **Removed duplicate contact details** from the left info card in the contact form section (`app/contact/page.tsx`)
   - Removed: email (info@trinade.com), phone (+91 9490754923), address, social icon links
   - These were duplicated — same info already exists in the footer
2. **Replaced with editorial value proposition text**:
   - "GET IN TOUCH" eyebrow label
   - "Let's build the future, together." headline with "together." in gold (#c9a86e)
   - Paragraph: "Every great partnership starts with a conversation..."
   - Gold gradient separator line
   - Three numbered promises: 01 (24hr response), 02 (Free consultation), 03 (No commitment)
3. **Cleaned up unused code**: Removed InstagramIcon, LinkedInIcon, XIcon component definitions that were no longer referenced

### Design Decisions
- Editorial approach over utilitarian — the left card now sells the conversation rather than listing contact info
- Numbered promises use subtle gold accent for numbers, white at 65% opacity for text
- Gold gradient separator adds visual rhythm between paragraph and promises

---

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 9: ScrollCards Fix + Challenges Redesign + Preloader (IN PROGRESS)

   - Transition: top/bottom halves split apart revealing page
   - Gold particle burst during transition
   - SessionStorage check to show only once per session
   - Integrated into `app/page.tsx` via dynamic import

### Unverified (server wouldn't start for Playwright testing)
- All visual output of the above changes
- Potential layout issues or animation timing

---

## 2026-03-15 — Prompt 7: Solutions Page & Company Page Perfected

### What Was Done
Complete redo of Prompt 6 with higher quality. Browsed IT Solutions Inc live with Playwright to capture exact CSS structure, then perfected both pages.

### Solutions Page (`solutions-content.tsx`)
1. **Scroll cards section perfected** — Sticky 100vh container with `spiral-lines-gold.jpg`, heading pinned at `absolute bottom-10 left-10`, white cards on right 48% width scrolling upward (matching IT Solutions Inc exact layout)
2. **Card backgrounds fixed** — Clean cream/off-white cards with gold bottom border on hover, no gradient blobs, readable text on hover
3. **Content rebalanced** — 40% AI / 60% other: Cybersecurity & Compliance, Cloud Infrastructure, Managed IT Services, AI & Data Intelligence, Strategic Consulting, Professional Services

## 2026-03-15 — Prompt 5: Company Page Awwwards Redesign

### What Was Done
Complete redesign of `/company` page with 8 cinematic sections, each with a unique layout pattern. Independent design approach — no template repetition across sections.

### Page Architecture (8 Sections)
1. **Hero** (dark) — Letter-by-letter "TRINADE" reveal animation, gold gradient eyebrow, atmospheric gradient orbs, grain overlay
2. **Vision** (cream) — Editorial split layout: large italic quote left, description right, gold rule divider
3. **Mission** (dark) — 3-pillar grid with numbered gold accent bars, staggered reveal animations
4. **Values** (dark) — 6 interactive cards with SVG icons, hover lift/glow/gold accent bar, 3x2 grid
5. **Journey** (cream) — Alternating left/right timeline with animated gold connecting line, 6 milestones (2021-2026)
6. **Team** (cream) — 3x2 grid with mesh gradient portrait placeholders, hover scale/shadow, role + bio text
7. **Impact** (dark) — 4 animated stat counters (scroll-triggered), glassmorphic stat cards
8. **CTA** (dark) — Cinematic closing with dual CTAs, atmospheric gradients

### Section Transitions
- 120px linear-gradient dividers between dark↔cream sections (DarkToLight / LightToDark components)

### Other Changes
- **Navbar pill width** — Increased inner pill padding from `px-2.5 gap-1.5` to `px-4 gap-2.5` for better spacing
- **Logo fix** — Copied missing `logo-transparent.png` to worktree
- **Team grid** — Changed from `auto-fit minmax` to `repeat(3, 1fr)` to force clean 3+3 layout

### Key Components Created (in company/page.tsx)
- `HeroLetterReveal` — Staggered letter animation with blur-in effect
- `WordReveal` — Per-word scroll-triggered reveal
- `AnimatedStat` — Intersection-observer counting animation
- `TeamCard` — Hover-interactive team member card with mesh gradient
- `ValueCard` — Interactive value card with icon, hover glow, gold accent
- `TimelineNode` — Alternating timeline entry with animated connecting line
- `Grain`, `GoldRule`, `SectionEyebrow`, `Reveal` — Reusable section utilities

### Technical Decisions
- Dark hero opening differentiates Company from other pages (which use cream heroes)
- All animations use `useInView` (not `useScroll({ target })`) to avoid hydration errors
- Mesh gradient backgrounds for team portraits use CSS `radial-gradient` stacking
- Grain overlay via inline SVG `feTurbulence` filter for atmospheric depth

### Files Modified
- `trinade-new/app/company/page.tsx` — Complete rewrite (~900 lines, +1085/-626)
- `trinade-new/components/solutions-navbar.tsx` — Pill width increase (+2/-2)

## 2026-03-15 — IT Solutions-Inspired Redesign: Industries Grid + Homepage

### Context
- Extracted 115 frames from `IT Solutions.webm` video at 2fps using ffmpeg
- Analyzed each frame to map IT Solutions sections to our Solutions page
- Identified 3 sections needing improvement + 3 unused sections for Homepage

### Section Mapping (IT Solutions → Trinade)
| IT Solutions Section | Our Section | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Hero with inline pill images | HeroSection | Already inspired ✓ |
| Industries grid (3 large + 2x2 small) | IndustriesSection | **Fixed** — was horizontal scroll |

## 2026-03-15 — Cursor Hover Fix + Homepage Section Cleanup + Content Update

### Cursor Fix
- **Problem**: When hovering over a button, the small dot (fast lerp 0.35) arrived first and triggered the hover expansion immediately, before the large dot (slow lerp 0.1) reached the button. This looked jarring — the ring expanded in empty space.
- **Fix**: Changed hover detection from `mouseover` event-based to position-based. The `mouseover` event now stores the `pendingHoverEl` but does NOT activate hover. Instead, the RAF tick loop checks if the large dot's (x,y) position is within the element's bounding rect (with 8px margin). Only when the large dot physically arrives does the hover ring activate.
- **Result**: Hover expansion now triggers naturally when the trailing large dot reaches the interactive element.

### Homepage Section Removal
1. **Removed "Overcoming enterprise roadblocks"** (ChallengesSection) — sticky text + challenge cards with tags
2. **Removed "Platform" and "People"** (DifferentiatorsSection) — large split cards with spiral imagery
3. **Removed unused `challenges` data array**
4. Both sections reserved for future Home Page reimplementation

### Content Updates
- **Hero headline**: "At Trinade, we've engineered solutions to address every challenge..." → "We build intelligent systems that transform how enterprises think, operate, and grow — confidently."
- **Mission text**: Updated to "Trinade AI Technologies crafts modular, scalable AI solutions — from predictive intelligence and secure cloud infrastructure to enterprise integration — engineered with precision and delivered with conviction."

### Verification (Playwright MCP)

- Footer intact ✓

Inspired by Creative Apes (Awwwards), rebuilt the entire blog page:

**Hero Section (Dark Editorial)**
- Full-viewport dark (#0a0a0a) background with atmospheric warm orbs
- Right-aligned editorial description text (large, light weight, cream)
- Bottom metadata bar: "© Fresh perspectives" / "(Journal — 08)" / "Thinking out loud"
- Scrolling marquee: "featured articles ©" in giant ghost text (font-weight 200, 6% opacity)

**Featured Article (Dark Split Card)**
- Full-width split card on dark background: gradient image left + dark glass content right
- "01 — Featured" label with gold rule
- Category pill, author info, hover arrow animation

**Article Listing (Vertical Editorial Cards)**
- Long vertical card design — each article is a full-width horizontal row
- Numbered entries (02–07) with gold category pills
- Left: large headline title, Right: excerpt + author
- Subtle gold dividers between cards
- Hover: background tint + gold underline + arrow animation
- "All Articles" header with count

**Other Sections**
- Dark→cream gradient transition between featured and article list
- Newsletter CTA (kept from previous, dark section)
- Topics section with pill tags (kept from previous)

### Files Modified
- `components/premium-cursor.tsx` — Gold hover ring, reduced size 50→46
- `app/blog/page.tsx` — Complete redesign (dark hero, vertical cards, marquee)

## 2026-03-15 — Cursor Refinements (No Blur + Slightly Bigger Small Dot)

### Problems
1. **Hover blur**: `backdrop-filter: blur(4px)` on hover ring was blurring text behind cursor — should be see-through
2. **Small dot too small**: 6px felt too tiny — user wanted it slightly bigger

### Fixes
- Removed `backdrop-filter` blur from hover state → content behind ring stays crystal clear
- Increased `SMALL_DOT` from 6px → 8px (subtle +2px)
- Liquid glass effect is now purely outline border + glow box-shadow, no blur

### Files Modified
- `components/premium-cursor.tsx` — SMALL_DOT 6→8, removed backdrop-filter blur on hover

---

## 2026-03-15 — Premium Dual-Dot Cursor Fix

### Problem
Custom cursor was a single dot (20px white circle with mix-blend-mode difference). User wanted:
1. **Two dots** — a small inner dot (6px) that follows cursor tightly + a larger trailing dot (20px) that lags behind
2. **On hover** — large dot expands to 50px liquid glass outlined ring (transparent bg, white border, backdrop-blur)

### Solution
- Created shared `components/premium-cursor.tsx` with dual-dot architecture:
  - Small dot: 6px, solid white, lerp 0.35 (fast follow), disappears on hover
  - Large dot: 20px, radial gradient, lerp 0.1 (elegant trail), expands to 50px liquid glass ring on hover
  - Hover state: transparent background + `1.5px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.85)` border + `backdrop-blur(4px) saturate(1.2)`
- Replaced inline `PremiumCursor` functions in all 6 page files with dynamic import of shared component
- Cleaned up unused imports (`useRef`, `useEffect`, `BASE_SIZE`, `HOVER_SIZE` constants)

### Verification (Playwright MCP)
- Confirmed 2 cursor DOM elements on homepage (z-index 99999 + 99998)
- Simulated hover on Menu button — verified expansion, border, backdrop-filter all activate
- Confirmed cursor works on `/contact` page too — 2 elements, correct sizes

### Files Modified
- `components/premium-cursor.tsx` — NEW shared cursor component
- `app/page.tsx` — replaced inline PremiumCursor with dynamic import
- `app/blog/page.tsx` — replaced inline PremiumCursor with dynamic import
- `app/company/page.tsx` — replaced inline PremiumCursor with dynamic import
- `app/contact/page.tsx` — replaced inline PremiumCursor with dynamic import
- `app/privacy-policy/page.tsx` — replaced inline PremiumCursor with dynamic import
- `app/terms-of-service/page.tsx` — replaced inline PremiumCursor with dynamic import

## 2026-03-14 — Full Site Verification + Vercel Deployment

### Playwright MCP Verification (localhost:3006)
- Verified all 6 pages: `/`, `/blog`, `/company`, `/contact`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`
- Verified shared components: navbar (wordmark + menu pill + logo), footer (gold glass card + nav + social icons + copyright), cookie popup, smooth scroll + scroll indicator
- Tested navbar menu overlay interaction: opens/closes, all links navigate correctly
- Scrolled through all homepage sections (7 total) to trigger `useInView` animations — all rendering
- **Zero console errors** across all pages

### Bug Fix
- **Missing image**: `spiral-grain-dark.jpg` was referenced in `solutions-content.tsx` (social proof "People" card) but never copied to `trinade-new/public/`. Copied from parent project. Now renders correctly.

### Working Preferences Update
- Added strict rule to `working-preferences.md`: "NEVER use Preview mode tools — always use Playwright MCP instead"

### Vercel Production Deployment
- Deployed to Vercel: **https://trinade-new.vercel.app**
- Project: `george-gideon-sales-projects/trinade-new`
- Build: All 6 pages statically generated, zero errors
- Only issue: missing `favicon.ico` (404) — cosmetic, needs favicon added
- Verified live site via Playwright MCP — identical to localhost

### Files Modified
- `working-preferences.md` — Added "NEVER use Preview mode" instruction
- `public/spiral-grain-dark.jpg` — Copied missing image asset

## Consolidated History (Pre-2026-03-13)

### Footer Evolution
- Started with basic footer → Datawizz-inspired redesign with giant "TRINADE" text, SVG social icons, atmospheric gradient layers, grain overlay
- Multiple iterations: spacing, breathing room, bottom bar visibility, viewport height fitting
- Final: `h-screen flex flex-col`, `text-[clamp(5rem,12vw,14vw)]`, 7 gradient orbs, conditional WebGL via `withBackground` prop

### Theme Evolution
- Started with dark-only theme → switched to light/dark hybrid
- Light sections: warm cream (#f5f3ef → tried #f0e6d3 → #f8f5f0 → settled on #e8e4de/#f5f3ef)
- Fixed hero bg flash issue (WebGL bg was being covered by light bg during reveal)
- Adaptive cursor: auto-switches dark/light via CSS

### Page Build History
- **About page**: 8-section cinematic page (~1050 lines). Manifesto hero, origin story, philosophy (teal-numbered editorial rows), journey timeline, stats, values, team teaser, closing CTA. Company founded in 2020.
- **Team page**: Cinematic intro + 8 member rows with NextNet-inspired full-width horizontal layout, mesh gradient portrait placeholders, click-to-expand bios
- **Contact V1→V2→V3**: Evolved from basic form → glassmorphic dark design → premium editorial dark layout with oversized typography, split layout, community section

### Background Experiments
- Hero background concepts page with 5 green gradient variations
- Footer concepts page with 10 distinct variations
- Contact page backgrounds: tried MagicUI DotPattern with glow (5520 animated SVGs — caused severe lag), replaced with lightweight CSS dot pattern tile

### Typography & Font
- Explored 10 fonts → settled on Manrope (single unified family, weights 200-800)
- Scaled up site-wide to Awwwards-level oversized sizing

## 2026-03-14 — Website Separation: Standalone New Website

### What Was Done
- Created `trinade-new/` as a standalone Next.js 15 project completely separate from the old website
- **New project structure**: Own `package.json` (port 3006), `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `globals.css`, `layout.tsx`
- **Pages copied with updated links** (removed `/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page/` prefix):
  - `app/page.tsx` — Homepage (was solutions main page)
  - `app/blog/page.tsx` — Blog
  - `app/company/page.tsx` — Company
  - `app/contact/page.tsx` — Contact
  - `app/privacy-policy/page.tsx` — Privacy Policy
  - `app/terms-of-service/page.tsx` — Terms of Service
- **Components copied**: solutions-navbar, solutions-footer, solutions-content, solutions-cookie-popup, smooth-scroll (all with updated links)
- **Assets copied**: logo-transparent.png + all decorative images (gradient-orbs-warm, spiral-card/motion/rotated/arcs/gold, gradient-mesh-warm)
- **Dependencies**: motion, lenis, next, react, tailwindcss (no R3F/GSAP/ShadCN — clean and lean)
- **MD files duplicated**: CLAUDE.md and SESSION_LOG.md exist in both directories
- **Verification**: Both projects build successfully (`next build`), both run on separate ports (old: 3005, new: 3006), verified via Playwright MCP screenshots

### Files Created
- `trinade-new/` — Complete standalone project directory
- All config files, 6 page files, 5 component files, 8 public assets

## 2026-03-14 — Solutions Ecosystem: 6-Task Batch (Blog + Polish)

### Tasks Completed
1. **Blog page created** — Awwwards-quality editorial magazine at `/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page/blog`. Hero with staggered word reveals, featured article split card with gradient mesh, 3-col article grid (6 cards with unique warm gradients), category filter pills, newsletter CTA dark section, explore topics tag grid, SolutionsFooter.
2. **Footer tint** — Increased gold glass opacity from 0.14→0.22 for clearer visibility against #0a0a0a black background. Social icon buttons also slightly tinted up.
3. **Contact page background** — Replaced terrible `/spiral-gold.jpg` with atmospheric CSS-only background: 3 radial gradient orbs (gold/amber/cream), grain overlay, "CONTACT" watermark at 30vw/3% opacity, animated gold line under title. Background color updated to #f2ede6.
4. **Privacy/Terms jiggle fix** — Removed `y: 35`/`y: 40` from section animations (was causing layout cascade jiggle). Now opacity-only fade-in (`initial={{ opacity: 0 }}`). Alternate section color changed from #faf7f2 to #ebe5db for better harmony.
5. **Logo moved to top right** — `fixed top-5 right-8 z-[9999]`, 28px, inverted filter
6. **Trinade text inertia-style** — Extended 'e' with double horizontal strokes (top at 28%, middle at 52%), right extension -14px. Font 22px/800/-0.04em.

### Files Created
- `app/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page/blog/page.tsx` — Full blog page (~500 lines)

### Files Modified
- `components/solutions-navbar.tsx` — Logo to right, trinade text inertia-style, blog link updated
- `components/solutions-footer.tsx` — Tinted gold glass, blog link updated
- `components/solutions-content.tsx` — Matching footer tint + social icon tint
- `app/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page/contact/page.tsx` — Atmospheric CSS bg, removed Image import
- `app/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page/privacy-policy/page.tsx` — Jiggle fix + color harmony
- `app/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page/terms-of-service/page.tsx` — Jiggle fix + color harmony

## 2026-03-14 — Solutions Ecosystem: 7-Task Polish Pass

### Tasks Completed
1. **Navbar/Cookie/Footer gold glass consistency** — Darkened dropdown panel to `rgba(210,192,158,0.95)`, applied same darker gold glass to cookie popup, scroll percentage pill, scroll indicator segments
2. **Company page Awwwards redesign** — Complete rewrite with Highful Minds inspiration: giant "Est 2025" gradient text hero, cinematic mission statement, dark glassmorphic value cards with gold icons, animated stat counters, tech expertise tags, CTA section, SolutionsFooter included. Fixed Motion v12 `useScroll` hydration error by removing parallax code.
3. **Footer brown gold liquid glass** — Card upgraded with `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`, gold gradient background, matching border styling
4. **Privacy Policy & Terms of Service colors** — Replaced `#e8e4de`/`#f5f3ef` alternating backgrounds with `#f2ede6`/`#faf7f2` to match solutions page beginning
5. **Instagram icon fix** — Replaced text labels with proper SVG icons for LinkedIn, Instagram, X in footer
6. **Inertia-style trinade wordmark** — Extended 'n' letter with horizontal CSS stroke (absolute positioned pseudo-element), 20px/800 weight, `-0.03em` tracking
7. **Logo repositioned** — Moved to top left (fixed, `top-5 left-8`), 28px size, parallel to navbar

### Files Modified
- `components/solutions-navbar.tsx` — Darkened gold glass, inertia-style wordmark, logo positioning
- `components/solutions-cookie-popup.tsx` — Matching gold glass styling
- `components/solutions-footer.tsx` — Brown gold liquid glass card, SVG social icons
- `components/solutions-content.tsx` — Inline footer updates (social icons, gold glass)
- `app/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page/company/page.tsx` — Complete Awwwards-quality rewrite
- `app/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page/privacy-policy/page.tsx` — Background color update
- `app/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page/terms-of-service/page.tsx` — Background color update

### Key Technical Decisions
- Motion v12 `useScroll({ target })` causes "Target ref is defined but not hydrated" on plain elements — removed in favor of simple `initial/animate` opacity
- Consistent gold glass palette: `rgba(210,192,158,0.95)` (dropdown), `rgba(185,155,100,0.6-0.7)` (pills/indicators)
- CSS pseudo-element technique for extended letter effect (no font modifications needed)

## 2026-03-14 — Experimental Solutions Page: GOD MODE Design

### Research Phase
- Extracted 129 snapshots from 5 reference website video recordings using ffmpeg (every 2 seconds)
- Deep analysis of each reference site:
  - **Harkcap** — Sliding info cards (left nav + right expanding panel with large number badges)
  - **Aventura Dental Arts** — Luxurious backgrounds, atmospheric dark sections, numbered carousels
  - **IT Solutions Inc** — Overall page structure, hero, industry cards, accordion services, testimonials
  - **WA Solutions** — Diagonal section transitions, glassmorphic cards, perspective dashboard mockups
  - **Richtech Robotics** — Neon cyan glow accents, credibility grid, light+dark split layouts
- Researched 2026 premium web design trends (aurora gradients, dark glassmorphism, SVG grain, scroll-driven animations)
- Extracted WebGL hero color palette from shaders.ts for cohesive identity

### V1 Color Palette (from WebGL hero shaders — NO neon)
- Deep teal bg: #091911, #0e3020, #124129
- Amber/gold ribbons: #9e7533 (base), #d9b873 (highlight), #594019 (dark)
- Green reflections: #264d2e, #145033
- Brand teal accent: #00d4aa (aligned with WGSN 2026 "Transformative Teal" trend)

### V1 Page Architecture (7 sections) — REPLACED by V2
1. Cinematic Hero with aurora gradient mesh bg
2. Sliding Solutions Cards (Harkcap-inspired)
3. Industry Grid on cream bg
4. Feature Showcase with split layouts
5. Differentiators Accordion
6. Social Proof grid
7. CTA Section with rounded card

### V2 Rebuild — Complete Independent Design System
**User Feedback on V1**: Page looked too similar to existing Trinade website. Design patterns leaked in (teal, sparkles, split-opacity headlines). Backgrounds were generic. Must be COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT.

**V2 Color Palette** (charcoal/cream/gold — NO teal, NO green):
- Charcoal: #1a1a1e (base), #242428 (light), #2c2c30 (mid), #3a3a3c (border)
- Cream: #f2ede6 (base), #e5e0d8 (dark), #faf9f7 (white)
- Gold accent: #c9a86e (base), #d4bb8a (light), #a08040 (dark)
- Burgundy secondary: #8b4d5a (unused in V2 but available)

**V2 Page Architecture** (7 sections + gradient transitions):
1. **Hero** — Centered layout, atmospheric gradient orbs (gold + cool), watermark "SOLUTIONS" at 22vw/2% opacity, decorative horizontal lines, grain overlay
2. **Sliding Solutions** — Left nav (4 products) + right AnimatePresence panel, per-solution accent colors, top accent bar on panel, ghost italic numbers
3. **Industries** — Cream bg with dot pattern, 3-col grid with SVG icons in gold-tinted containers, numbers, hover lift+shadow+gold bottom line, description paragraph in header
4. **Feature Showcase** — Abstract dashboard mockup panels (bar charts, trend lines, grid lines, window chrome dots), glassmorphic stat overlays, alternating text/visual layout
5. **Differentiators** — Two-column: sticky heading left, accordion right. Expanded card has shadow + gold numbered labels + tag pills
6. **Social Proof** — Header row (label left, subtitle right), 4x2 grid with 1px border gaps, hover brightening
7. **CTA** — Rounded-[28px] card, multi-gradient background, dual atmospheric gold glows, decorative lines, "GET STARTED" label + centered headline + dual CTAs with hover glow shadow

**Section Transitions**: Gradient fades (DarkToLightTransition / LightToDarkTransition, 128px height) between charcoal↔cream sections

### Technical Implementation
- Route: `/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page` → `components/solutions-content.tsx` (~700 lines)
- Independent design tokens in `P` object (no CSS variables from globals.css used)
- Reusable `Grain` component for SVG noise overlays
- `IndustryIcon` component with 6 custom SVG icons
- Motion v12 AnimatePresence for card switching (blur-in/out transitions)
- CSS grid `order` for alternating feature layouts
- Alignment: `px-[clamp(2rem,8vw,8rem)]` on all sections
- No ✦ sparkle badges, no split-opacity headlines — uses simple uppercase labels with wide tracking (0.22em)
- Headlines at `clamp(3.5rem, 7vw, 7.5rem)` for hero, `clamp(2.4rem, 4.8vw, 4.2rem)` for sections
- Font weight 300 for headlines (light, editorial feel)

### Files Created/Modified
- `components/solutions-content.tsx` — Rebuilt from scratch (V2 independent design)
- `app/exactly-copied-inspirations-solutions-page/page.tsx` — Route (unchanged)
- `app/globals.css` — Aurora keyframes from V1 still present (no longer used by V2)
- `Solution Page Inspirations/` — 129 extracted reference frames (5 subdirectories)

---

## 2026-03-13 — Contact V3: Performance fix + Dropdown polish

### Performance Fix
- **Problem**: MagicUI DotPattern with `glow={true}` created 5,520 individual `<motion.circle>` elements with independent JS animation loops → severe lag
- **Fix**: Replaced with single CSS `background-image` using inline SVG data URI tile (28x28px) + `mask-image` radial gradient for fading effect
- DotPattern component kept in `components/ui/dot-pattern.tsx` for potential smaller-surface use

### Dropdown Polish (4 iterations)
1. Fixed double scrollbars (removed `max-h`/`overflow-y-auto` + `overflow-hidden` conflict)
2. Added `.scrollbar-premium` custom scrollbar class (3px teal-tinted, cross-browser)
3. User rejected scrollbar entirely → widened grid column to 220px, all 10 countries fit without scrolling
4. Fixed trackpad scroll capture: `onWheel stopPropagation` + `overscrollBehavior: contain`

### Contact V3 Background Layers
- CSS dot pattern tile (28x28px, teal, 14% opacity) with radial gradient mask
- Atmospheric layers: teal bloom top-left, amber undertone center-right, deep emerald bottom
- Cinematic vignette + grain texture overlay

### Real Contact Info Added
- Address: #06, Green Valley Apartments, Gorantla, Guntur, AP 522034, India
- Phone: +91 9490754923
- Email: info@trinade.com

- Installed ShadCN UI components (Input, Textarea, Label, Button) in `components/ui/`
- Installed MagicUI components (BlurFade, DotPattern) in `components/ui/`
- Premium background with CSS dot pattern + atmospheric gradient layers

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 10: Bug fixes, routing verification, navbar pill width

### Issues Found & Fixed
1. **Worktree server was still running on port 3008** — old worktree at `G:\Claude Worktrees\` was serving stale code with Solutions at `/`. PowerShell `Stop-Process` was needed to kill it (bash `taskkill` failed due to path mangling).
2. **Contact page hero text invisible** — `useInView` from motion/react doesn't trigger inside Lenis smooth scroll wrapper. Fixed by using `useState` + `useEffect` with `setTimeout(100ms)` for the hero (always visible on load).
3. **Contact page form section invisible** — Same `useInView` issue. Fixed with manual scroll event listener + `getBoundingClientRect()` check + 2s fallback timeout.
4. **Footer nav links broken** — "Products" and "Solutions" both pointed to `#`. Fixed: Home→`/`, Solutions→`/solutions`.
5. **Navbar pill too narrow** — Increased pill gap from `gap-2.5` to `gap-4`, padding from `px-4` to `px-5`, giving more breathing room between Menu text and scroll percentage.

### Key Lesson
**`useInView` from motion/react does NOT work inside Lenis smooth scroll.** Lenis uses `transform: translateY()` on a wrapper div, which means elements don't actually move relative to the viewport from IntersectionObserver's perspective. Use manual scroll listeners with `getBoundingClientRect()` or trigger animations on mount with `useEffect` for above-the-fold content.

### Files Changed
- `app/contact/page.tsx` — Replaced `useInView` with manual animation triggers
- `components/solutions-navbar.tsx` — Wider pill (gap-4, px-5)
- `components/solutions-footer.tsx` — Fixed nav links (Home→/, Solutions→/solutions)
- `HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` — Updated route table, added routing warnings

## 2026-03-16 — Prompt 10b: Navbar pill layout, active dot, footer label

### Changes
1. **Navbar pill layout** — Changed from `gap-4` centered to `justify-between` with `minWidth: 200px`. Menu/hamburger sits on the left, scroll percentage badge on the right. Proper spacing without cramping.
2. **Active page dot** — Made significantly darker: `#8b6914 → #6b4f0e → #a07820` gradient with stronger `boxShadow` (0.4 white inset highlight, 0.5 outer glow). Now clearly visible against the gold panel background.
3. **Footer "Products" label** — Restored "Products" text in footer nav (links to `/solutions`). User wants this label, not "Home".

### Files Changed
- `components/solutions-navbar.tsx` — Pill justify-between layout, darker active dot
- `components/solutions-footer.tsx` — Restored "Products" label
